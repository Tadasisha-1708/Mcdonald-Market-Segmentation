Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in certain ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits.

It enables companies to target specific groups with tailored promotions, products, or services that are most likely to resonate with them. Machine learning has become a popular tool for automating the process of customer segmentation, providing a more efficient and effective way to identify patterns and relationships within customer data.

There are several different methods for using machine learning to perform customer segmentation, including:-


1] Clustering algorithms: These algorithms divide customers into groups based on their characteristics and behaviour. For example, k-means Clustering can be used to find the k number of clusters in a dataset.


2] Decision trees: These algorithms use a tree-like model to identify the most important variables that influence customer behaviour. By using decision trees, companies can determine which customers are most likely to respond to certain marketing campaigns or products.


3] Neural networks: These algorithms can be used to model complex relationships between customers and their behaviour. Neural networks can identify patterns in customer data that are not easily recognizable through traditional methods.


4] Association rule learning: This method finds the relationships between customer attributes and behaviours, such as buying habits and product preferences. Association rule learning can help companies understand which products are frequently purchased together and target customers accordingly.
